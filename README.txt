added features:
read, write, touch, copy, remove, move, cat, wc, ln,
mkdir, rmdir, ls and pwd:
command <file name> without path refers to current folder.
(e.x mkdir hello, instead of mkdir V/hello)
when in folder other than root, no need to specify entire path.
(e.x when in V/hello, typing touch hi.txt
will create file, instread of touch V/hello/hi)


ls:
ls . (dot) prints current folders content

--help:

lproot:
lproot prints time stamp as well, updated every "touch", or edit.
